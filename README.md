Video-based action recognition is a highly active area of research in computer vision. However, current state-of-the-art results are still far from human accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel approach for human action recognition that feeds a RNN network with human keypoints only. This simplifies and speeds up the training process while achieving close to state-of-the-art accuracy in UCF-101 and around 15\% in Charades in verb-based classification.
